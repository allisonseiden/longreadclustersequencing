Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

Two different sets represent two different phasing attempts using different reads.

file name: set1_dnv.png
description: shows de novo variant. Highlighted reads do not contain de novo.

file name: set1_inform1.png
description: We see an insertion shared by patient and mother, not possessed by
father. The informative variant is present on the reads that do not contain
the de novo variant so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set1_zoomedout.png
description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.

file name: set2_inform1.png
description: highlighted reads do not contain de novo. We see a SNP shared by
patient and mother, not possessed by father. The informative variant is present
on the reads that do not contain the de novo variant so we phase the de novo to
the father.

file name: set2_inform2.png
description: here we see Illumina reads that are highlighted if they contain
the de novo variant. We also see an insertion on the right inherited by the mother
that is not present on the reads that contain the de novo variant. So we
phase the de novo to the father.
