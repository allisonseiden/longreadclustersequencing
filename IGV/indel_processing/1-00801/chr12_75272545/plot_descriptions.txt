Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

Two different sets represent two different phasing attempts using different reads.

file name: set1_zoomedout.png
description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing. Highlighted
reads are ones that contain the de novo variant. Informative insertion on the left
is an insertion inherited by the father and not present on any of the reads containing
the de novo. So we phase the de novo to the mother.

file name: set2_inform1.png
description: shows first informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
father, not possessed by mother. The variant is not present on the reads that contain
the de novo variant so we use this variant to phase the de novo to the mother.

file name: set2_inform2.png
description: we see two informative variants. We see both SNPs shared by patient and
father, neither possessed by mother. The variants are not present on the reads that contain
the de novo variant so we use this variant to phase the de novo to the mother.

file name: set2_inform3.png
description: here we see Illumina reads that are highlighted if they do not contain
the de novo variant. We also see an insertion on the left inherited by the father
that is present on these reads that do not contain the de novo variant. So we
phase the de novo to the mother.

file name: set2_inform4.png
description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.
