Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

Two different sets represent two different phasing attempts using different reads.

file name: set1_dnv.png
description: shows de novo variant. We highlight three reads in the PacBio track (blue,
green, and purple) that contain the de novo variant. We use the Illumina reads
for the patient to guide which reads to choose.

file name: set1_inform1.png
description: we see two informative variants. Both are shared by patient and father,
neither possessed by the mother. The variant is present on the same reads that
contain the de novo variant, so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set1_inform2.png
description: we have also highlighted the Illumina reads that contain the de novo
variant to use more high confidence data. We can see an insertion shared by patient
and father, not possessed by mother, on two reads that contain the de novo variant.
So we again phase the de novo to the father.

description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.

file name: set2_inform1.png
description: reads containing the de novo variant highlighted in brown. We see
an insertion shared by patient and father, not possessed by mother, also on
reads highlighted in brown. So we again phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set2_zoomedout.png
description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.
