Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

Two different sets represent two different phasing attempts using different reads.

description: highlighted reads contain de novo variant.

file name: set1_inform1.png
description: shows first informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
mother, not possessed by father. The variant is present on the reads that do not
contain the de novo variant so we use this variant to phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set1_inform2.png
description: shows second informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
mother, not possessed by father. The variant is present on the reads that do not
contain the de novo variant so we use this variant to phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set2_inform1.png
description: highlighted reads contain de novo variant. We see a SNP shared by
patient and mother, not possessed by father. The variant is present on the reads
that do not contain the de novo variant so we use this variant to phase the de
novo to the father.

description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.
