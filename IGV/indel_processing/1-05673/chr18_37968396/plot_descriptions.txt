description: de novo deletion contained in reads highlighted in pink and grey.

file name: inform1.png
description: we see a SNP where both patient and father are heterozygous and mother
is homozygous. Thus, the patient must have gotten the Ts from the father and the As
from the mother. The variant (A) is present on the highlighted reads, which contain
the de novo deletion, so we phase the de novo to the mother.

file name: inform2.png
description: we see a SNP shared by patient and father, not possessed by mother.
The variant is not present on the highlighted reads, which contain the de novo insertion,
so we phase the de novo to the mother.

file name: inform3.png
description: we see a SNP where both patient and father are heterozygous and mother
is homozygous. Thus, the patient must have gotten the Ts from the father and the As
from the mother. The variant (A) is present on the highlighted reads, which contain
the de novo deletion, so we phase the de novo to the mother.
