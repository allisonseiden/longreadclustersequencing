Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

Two different sets represent two different phasing attempts using different reads.

file name: set1_dnv.png
description: highlighted reads (red and blue) contain de novo deletion

file name: set1_inform1.png
description: shows first informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
father, and not possessed by mother. Since the variant is present on our
highlighted read, which also contains the de novo variant, we use this SNP
to phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set1_inform2.png
description: shows second informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
mother, and not possessed by father. Since the variant is not present on our
highlighted read, which contains the de novo variant, we use this SNP
to phase the de novo to the father.

description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.

file name: set2_inform1.png
description: shows first informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
mother, and not possessed by father. Since the variant is not present on our
highlighted read, which contains the de novo variant, we use this SNP
to phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set2_inform2.png
description: shows second informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
father, and not possessed by mother. Since the variant is present on our
highlighted read, which also contains the de novo variant, we use this SNP
to phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set2_inform3.png
description: shows third informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
mother, and not possessed by father. Since the variant is not present on our
highlighted read, which contains the de novo variant, we use this SNP
to phase the de novo to the father.

file name: set2_inform4.png
description: here we highlight the Illumina reads that contain the de novo deletion.
The insertion to the left of the de novo is shared by patient and mother, not
possessed by father. Since the variant is not present on our highlighted Illumina
reads, which contain the de novo variant, we use this insertion to phase the
de novo to the father.
