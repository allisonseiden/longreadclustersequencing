description: shows first informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
father, and not possessed by mother. Since the variant is not present on our
highlighted reads, which contain the de novo variant, we use this SNP
to phase the de novo to the mother.

description: shows second informative variant. We see a SNP shared by patient and
mother, and not possessed by father. Since the variant is present on our
highlighted reads, which contain the de novo variant, we use this SNP
to phase the de novo to the mother.
