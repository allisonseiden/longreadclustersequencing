# IGV plot for manual indel phasing

## Directory descriptions
Directories are labeled by patient ID number. Within each of these directories is:
- a screenshot of the de novo variant in IGV
- a screenshot for each of the informative variants in IGV or a screenshot showing there are no reliable informative variants

Each screenshot has a track for the patient's DNA reads in Illumina, the patient's DNA reads in Pacbio, the mother's DNA reads in Illumina, and the father's DNA reads in Illumina. The .txt file with the IGV plot descriptions will explain which track is which.
