# IGV plot for manual indel phasing

Directories are labeled by patient ID number. Within each of these directories is:
- a screenshot of the de novo variant in IGV
- a screenshot for each of the informative variants in IGV or a screenshot showing there are no reliable informative variants

Each screenshot has a track for the patient's DNA reads in Illumina, the patient's DNA reads in Pacbio, the mother's DNA reads in Illumina, and the father's DNA reads in Illumina.

**plot_descriptions.txt** contains detailed information about which tracks are which as well as how phasing was completed.
