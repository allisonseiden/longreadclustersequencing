# IGV plot for manual indel phasing

Directories are labeled by patient ID number. Within each of these directories is:
- a screenshot of the de novo variant in IGV
- a screenshot for each of the informative variants in IGV or a screenshot showing there are no reliable informative variants

Each screenshot has a track for the patient's DNA reads in Illumina (ID_edit_sorted.bam), the patient's DNA reads in Pacbio (ID.hg38...cram), the mother's DNA reads in Illumina (ID-01.hg38...cram), and the father's DNA reads in Illumina (ID-02.hg38...cram).
