description: de novo deletion contained in reads highlighted in purple and brown.

file name: inform1.png
description: we see a SNP shared by patient and mother, not possessed by father.
The variant is not present on the highlighted reads, which contain the de novo deletion,
so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: inform2.png
description: here we have highlighted the Illumina reads that contain the de novo
deletion. We see a SNP shared by patient and mother, not possessed by father that is
not present on the highlighted reads, which contain the de novo deletion, so
we phase the de novo to the father.

description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.
