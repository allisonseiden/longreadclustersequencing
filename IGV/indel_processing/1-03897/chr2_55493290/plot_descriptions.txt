Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

description: highlighted reads (purple and green) contain de novo deletion.

file name: inform1.png
description: we have a SNP where patient and father are heterozygous and mother
is homozygous. Thus, patient had to get Ts from father. Since we have Ts on reads
that do not contain the de novo variant, we use this informative SNP to phase
the de novo to father.

file name: inform2.png
description: we have two informative SNPs shared by patient and mother, and not
possessed by father. Since the variant is not present on our highlighted read,
which contains the de novo variant, we use this SNP to phase the de novo to the
father.

description: a screenshot to show how close the informative variants are to the
de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.
