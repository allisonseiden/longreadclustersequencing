description: de novo deletion on read highlighted in pink

file name: inform1.png
description: we see a SNP shared by patient and mother, not possessed by father
on reads that do not contain the de novo variant. So we phase the de novo
deletion to the father.

file name: inform2.png
description: we have two informative SNPs, both shared by patient and father,
neither possessed by mother. The variant is present on the highlighted read, which
contains the de novo deletion, so we phase the de novo to the father.
