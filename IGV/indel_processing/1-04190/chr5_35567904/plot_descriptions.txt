Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

description: de novo deletion contained in reads highlighted in yellow and grey.

file name: inform1.png
description: we see a SNP shared by patient and father, not possessed by mother.
The variant is present on the highlighted read, which contains the de novo deletion,
so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: inform2.png
description: we see a SNP shared by patient and mother, not possessed by father.
The variant is not present on the highlighted reads, which contain the de novo deletion,
so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: inform3.png
description: we have two informative SNPs shared by patient and father, not
possessed by mother. The variants are both present on the highlighted reads,
which contain the de novo deletion, so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: inform4.png
description: here we highlight the Illumina reads that contain the de novo deletion.
We have an informative SNP shared by patient and father, not possessed by mother.
The variants are both present on the highlighted reads, which contain the de
novo deletion, so we phase the de novo to the father.

de novo variant, and to show the coverage of the reads used for phasing.
