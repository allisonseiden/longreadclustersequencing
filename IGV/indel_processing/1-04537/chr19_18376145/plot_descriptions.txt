Track order for all plots, in order from top to bottom:
- PacBio reads for patient
- Illumina reads for patient
- Illumina reads for Mom
- Illumina reads for Dad

description: the highlighted reads contain the de novo variant.
We see a SNP where both patient and mother are heterozygous and father
is homozygous. Thus, the patient must have gotten the Gs from the mother and the Ts
from the father. The variant (T) is present on the highlighted reads, which contain
the de novo variant, so we phase the de novo to the father.

description: we see a SNP where both patient and mother are heterozygous and father
is homozygous. Thus, the patient must have gotten the As from the mother and the Gs
from the father. The variant (G) is present on the highlighted reads, which contain
the de novo variant, so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: inform3.png
description: we see a SNP shared by patient and mother, not possessed by father.
The variant is not present on the highlighted read, which contains the de novo
variant, so we phase the de novo to the father.
