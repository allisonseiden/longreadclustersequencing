description: de novo deletion contained in reads highlighted in pink and yellow.

file name: inform1.png
description: we see a SNP shared by patient and father, not possessed by mother.
The variant is present on the highlighted read, which contains the de novo deletion,
so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: inform2.png
description: we see a SNP where both patient and mother are heterozygous and father
is homozygous. Thus, the patient must have gotten the As from the mother and the Gs
from the father. The variant (G) is present on the highlighted read, which contains
the de novo deletion, so we phase the de novo to the father.

file name: inform3.png
description: we see a SNP where both patient and mother are heterozygous and father
is homozygous. Thus, the patient must have gotten the Cs from the mother and the Ts
from the father. The variant (T) is present on the highlighted read, which contains
the de novo deletion, so we phase the de novo to the father.
