create a class with instance variables:
  patient ID
  bed file data frame
  dictionary with chromosome key and value is vcf data frame
  dictionary with bounds

functions:
  make dictionary from bed file with keys that are chromosomes and value is list of de novo positions on that chromosome
  search discontinuities function
  function that returns bounds (change from search discontinuities function, make it's own getter function)


in main function:
create objects for each patient 
run functions in order for each patient
can use for loop with IDs? only need IDs for bed file and vcf file names
