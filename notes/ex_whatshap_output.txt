======== Working on chromosome 'chr20'
---- Processing individual 1-00801
Using maximum coverage per sample of 15X
Number of variants skipped due to missing genotypes: 911
Number of remaining heterozygous variants: 58904
Reading alignments and detecting alleles ...
Found 64002 reads covering 58263 variants
Kept 49817 reads that cover at least two variants each
Reducing coverage to at most 15X by selecting most informative reads ...
Selected 47476 reads covering 57908 variants
Best-case phasing would result in 1145 non-singleton phased blocks (1500 in total)
... after read selection: 1145 non-singleton phased blocks (1145 in total)
Variants covered by at least one phase-informative read in at least one individual after read selection: 57908
Phasing 1 sample by solving the MEC problem ...
MEC cost: 635400
No. of phased blocks: 1145
Largest component contains 938 variants (1.6% of accessible variants) between position 30318570 and 30418203
