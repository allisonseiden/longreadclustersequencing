load BED file into pandas
group by chromosome
subtract start values of every pair
if the value is less than [tolerance for cluster] then
num_clusters++
if not, move on
do for every chromosome
make sure not to override the num_clusters for each chromosome -- maybe store in a separate list
or add a column for each group that has num_clusters value
can then sum all the clusters per patient
